# European Soccer Data Analysis Using Python 
UCSD-Edx Python for Data Science MicroMasters Project

## Motivation:

* Gain valuable insight on which players to pick for a high scoring fantasy soccer team.
* Assist with the coaches' decisions on field placement for athletes, especially strikers.
* Provide information that will help teams strategically build a game plan for upcoming matches.

## Research Questions: 

1. Is there a correlation between high scoring soccer players and the amount of shot power they have?
2. What is the likelihood of either a right-footed or left-footed player scoring a goal based off of their current shot power?
3. Are there more right foot players than left foot players? Does this affect the result of question 2?


## Requirements
Jupyter Notebook may be used with any OS. 
Ensure you have pip installed the latest versions of the following:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Scipy
